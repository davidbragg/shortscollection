## Short Synopsis

After failing to take his own life with an overdose of booze and pills, a middle-aged failed author finds the writings he attempted to destroy the previous night arranged on the walls and annotated seemingly at random. Despite failing to make any sense of the notes he finds the inspiration in the pages to continue on writing.

## Full Synopsis

Wash, a middle-aged and ailing failed author, returns home with yet another prescription. Glancing briefly at his most recent writings he to chooses dump all of his pages into a running shower. With all the physical copies of his writing soaking in the bathtub he gets to work on deleting all his files while downing all the pills in the house, chased with a bottle of vodka.

By the time the regret sets in he is too far gone. Desperate to undo the pills and the vodka, Wash find he's become too intoxicated to save himself. He collapses onto the floor and loses consciousness.

When he miraculously wakes the next afternoon in his bathroom he discovers that his apartment livingroom has been completely rearranged. The contents of his apartment have been moved into the center of the room and arranged into a precarious pile. As he goes to investigate he finds all his waterlogged pages pasted to the wall in ad hoc wallpaper. The pages have been heavily annotated.

Wash flashes back to his manic writings on the wall the night prior. Howling and proclaiming his own genius as he goes.

As Wash inspects the annotations closer it quickly becomes apparent that it's meaningless. He pulls down pages, slowly spreading out. It's all disheartening gibberish.

After clearing a space on the wall Wash steps back. The blank wall catches his eye. He steps in an widens the clearing even further. 

Content with the wall as it is, Wash fishes his laptop out of the pile of his belonging. He opens it up to find it still works. He sits down on the floor and begins writing.
